A modified CTP that uses Fraction of energy depletion as a metric instead of ETX. Fraction of energy 
depletion was calculated by dividing the volatge of the batteries by energy consumption to trnasmit a
 data packet and even though the relation of volatge and energy isn't linear. It gives a approximate
estimation of remaining energy. Then instead of ETX FED(GFraction of energy depletion) was used as the metric for CTP.
This protocol was deployed and tested in TelosB sensor mote.
